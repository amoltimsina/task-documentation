## Task:

- **Establish a password-less SSH connection from the `Starting Machine` to `Machine 1` via port 3222, specifically logging in as `User1`.**
  
- **As `User1` on `Machine1`, SSH into `Machine2` using the domain instead of the IP, and authenticate as `User2`.**

- **Configure permissions such that only `User2` on `Machine2` can execute the `docker ps` command in the terminal.**

**Note:** Ensure that `User1` and `User2` do not have unnecessary privileges, such as superuser access.
