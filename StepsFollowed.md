# Solution
## Steps followed:

-   Make sure the machines are connected to the same network. Use `ifconfig` to validate IP addresses.
-   As we need to access `User1` in `Machine1`, make sure the user exists in the said machine. If not enter the following command: 

    - `sudo adduser user1` (in Machine1)
-   Now in the `Starting Machine`, check if there are any SSH keys already generated using `cd ~/.ssh`. These files are generally named `idrsa` and `idrsa.pub` where the former is a private key and the latter is a public key.
-   If not, use the command: `ssh-keygen` (in Starting Machine) and follow the necessary steps. You are also prompted to create a Passphrase, which is basically a password to protect your private key.

-   Now as we need Machine1 to be listening at a specified port, we can change the default 22 port to 3222 by:
    -   `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    -   Change the default 22 port to `3222`

-    After the creation of an SSH Key, it is necessary for the public key to be present in the machine you are trying to access in order to login password-free. In our situation, the public key from Starting Machine should be added to Machine1.
        
        -   Use `ssh-copy-id -p <port> <user_name>@ip/domain` to copy your public IP to the machine you are trying to access. In our case, `ssh-copy-id -p 3222 
        -   If this does not work, it is also possible to manually copy your public key and paste it in `~/.ssh` in a file named `authorized_keys` which can be created using `nano authorized_keys`. Make sure the permissions to `authorized_keys` is `600` and the users and groups is `User1` itself.

        Note: All of this should be done on `Machine1`
          

-   Now, the `Starting Machine` can try accessing `Machine1` as follows:
    -   `ssh -p 3222 user1@<ip_of_machine1>`

    These steps should grant you access to Machine1 from the Starting Machine. Remember, this process is just for the connection of the first two machines.
