# **Linux Task**

## **To-Do**
-   **Make a connection from `Starting Machine` to `Machine 1` using Password-less SSH authentication at a specific `port 3222`. Also note that the login should specifically be from the user `User1`**
-   **Now, as `User1` in `Machine1`, login to `Machine2` as `User2` using SSH, also note that a domain is used instead of IP.**
-   **Now, make sure `User2` in `Machine2` is the only user that is able to run `docker ps` command in the terminal**

Note: Remember `User1` and `User2` should not have unnecessary access like superuser.
